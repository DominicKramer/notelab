NoteLab_01-02-2007_04-04-20_v0.1.1.jar
----------------------------------------
With version 0.1.1 of NoteLab, a graphical installer and uninstaller have been developed to greatly improve the ease of installing and uninstalling NoteLab.  Also, version 0.1.1 has support for reading Jarnal files.  These files have a .jaj extension.

NoteLab_01-04-2007_10-25-23_v0.1.2rc1.jar
----------------------------------------
This is the first release candidate of the 0.1.2 build.  In this build the x, y, width, and height public fields of the TransformRectangle2D have been hidden so that direct access to them is impossible.  Instead getter and setter methods must be used to modify them.  This is much safer than having direct access to the fields.  In addition in the previous release if a document was saved on one system and opened on another, the documents would look different.  This has been fixed.

NoteLab_01-14-2007_07-04-16_v0.1.2rc3.jar
----------------------------------------
The third release candidate of the 0.1.2 series.  The previous release candidate set a Page's Paper's x or y coordinate to the same value value of the Page's x or y value.  However, the Paper's x or y value should always be zero since its coordinates are relative to the Page's top left corner.  Otherwise the user will not be allowed to draw on pages after the first one.  This was the problem with the previous release candidate and is now fixed in this candidate.

NoteLab_01-16-2007_12-30-05_v0.1.2rc4.jar
----------------------------------------
This servs as the fourth release candidate of the 0.1.2 series.  Small bugs were fixed.  These included a bug where dots drawn on pages after the first were not immediately painted and single selection wouldn't work if trying to select strokes on pages after the first.

NoteLab_02-04-2007_04-43-54_v0.1.2rc6.jar
----------------------------------------
With this version stroke smoothing has been enabled.  Also printing is now done in a separate thread and documents loaded at runtime have their filename displayed in NoteLab's main frame.

NoteLab_02-08-2007_08-01-48_v1.1.2rc7.jar
----------------------------------------
This build has smooth strokes implemented.  Strokes are combed and the rendering of strokes has been improved to make them look smoother.

NoteLab_02-09-2007_01-03-06_v0.1.2rc8.jar
----------------------------------------
This build has added safety in that the NoteLabFileChooser will ask the user if he/she wants to overwrite the currently selected file if it already exists.  Also the bug in the uninstaller has been fixed where the uninstaller couldn't remove the install dir on Windows based systems since it was already in use.  Now the task of uninstalling this directory is the job of the uninstall scripts.

NoteLab_02-09-2007_01-08-53_v0.1.2rc9.jar
----------------------------------------
The uninstaller could only get to 99% since the install directory is no longer being deleted by the uninstaller.  This has been fixed.

NoteLab_02-12-2007_11-25-01_v0.1.2rc10.jar
----------------------------------------
This build has a scrollpane added for toolbars so that users can select all buttons from the toolbar even if the screen is very small.
