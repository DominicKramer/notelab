Details
-------
1.  The previous version of NoteLab used a special statistical technique to smooth strokes 
    drawn.  The new version of NoteLab uses advanced interpolation techniques to smooth 
    strokes.  This means that smoothed strokes look substantially better than in the 
    previous version of NoteLab.

2.  SVGZ is the W3C standard for compressed SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image types.  
    If a session is exported as a SVGZ file, it will be substantially smaller than 
    a SVG file corresponding to the same session.

3.  When NoteLab constructs a page, it uses the display properties of the computer to 
    make the page look approximately 8.5x11 inches on the screen.  Unit scaling allows 
    the user to modify how NoteLab determines how many pixels on the screen correspond 
    to one inch or one centimeter.

    That is with a unit scale factor of 0.5, a page would look approximately half as 
    large as a 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper when drawn on the screen.

4.  Now when the canvas is being saved, printed, or exported it is momentarily locked 
    to avoid consistency problems between the current state of the canvas and the 
    state of the canvas saved, printed, or exported.

5.  The new status bar describes if saving, printing, or exporting of the canvas was 
    successful or not.

6.  By writing native NoteLab files in SVGZ instead of SVG format, the new native NoteLab 
    files are substantially smaller than their predecessors.
