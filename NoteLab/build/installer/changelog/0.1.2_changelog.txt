Details
-------
1. Now when the memory settings graphical element is opened it determines and displays the 
   current memory usage.

2. Now the current page is not highlighted unless the user is in the page selection mode.  
   This greatly improves performance while in writing mode.

3. Now documents saved on one system but opened on another system adapt to the different 
   screen resolutions so that the saved document looks the same if opened on any system.

4. Previously NoteLab needed an internet connection to download the SVG specification.  
   Now NoteLab has a copy of this specification internally and thus an internet connection 
   is not needed.

5. There was a bug with the NoteLab file loader in which it would always ignore one of the 
   points at the start of a stroke.  Now this bug has been fixed.
