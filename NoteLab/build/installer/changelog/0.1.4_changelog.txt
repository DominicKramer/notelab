NoteLab Version 0.1.4 Changelog
-------------------------------
Summary
-------
* New:  Added cut, copy, and paste functionality for entire pages.
* New:  Added the ability to edit page properties for many pages at a time. (see 1)
* New:  Added the ability to import NoteLab or Jarnal documents into the current session.
* New:  Now the extent to which stroke smoothing is done can be edited graphically.
* New:  Added progress bars which show the progress of saving, exporting, printing, and 
        opening sessions.
* New:  Added .command scripts for Mac OS X systems.
* New:  Now the startup scripts for Mac OS X systems set the dock icon and name. (see 2)

* Improvement:  Greatly improved the speed of stroke smoothing.
* Improvement:  Now the NoteLab startup scripts dynamically determine the location 
                of the NoteLab installation directory.  As such this directory can 
                be moved after NoteLab is installed and NoteLab will still work fine.

* Bug fix:  Fixed a bug where pages would not be copied correctly.  This would cause 
            printed sessions to look differently on paper copared to their look in 
            NoteLab.

Details
-------
1.  In previous versions of NoteLab, if the user wanted to change the background color of a 
    page or its paper type, he/she would have to select one page at a time and modify these 
    settings.  Now multiply pages can be selected, and the settings will be applied to 
    all of the pages selected.

2.  Now in Mac OS X when NoteLab is started, the icon placed in the system dock has the 
    NoteLab feather icon and the name of the application shown in the menu at the top of 
    the screen is not "NoteLab".
