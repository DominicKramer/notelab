This build fixes the bug where every time the user selected save, NoteLab would ask which file he/she wanted to save to.  It also fixes the bug where files were saved incorrectly and thus could not be loaded.

----------------------------------------
With this build, there is a set maximum number of items stored by the "undo-redo" system.  As such, the system only stores the last 25 actions which can be undone by the user.  This fixes a memory leak.  In addition, this limit should be large enough for most needs while still using minimal amounts of memory.  Also, redundant information is not stored in SVG files in this build.  As such, native NoteLab files will load faster.

NoteLab_11-16-2006_01-35-53_v0.1rc4.jar
----------------------------------------
With this build a memory leak has been fixed.  This memory leak occured when the user saved the current session.  If the user clicked save multiple time of the session would be created to be saved which could greatly decrease the memory available to NoteLab.  However this fix causes line widths to change after a session is saved only if the session is saved while it is zoomed (either in or out).  Even though I didn't have a fix for this bug I wanted to release a build that fixed the previoly mentioned bug.

NoteLab_11-19-2006_09-57-36_v11.19.2006-21.57-final.jar
----------------------------------------
This build represents a candidate for the 0.1final build.  Fixed by this build is a bug in the Pen class's scaleTo() method.  Now this method works as it should.  Also the save function was fixed in that previously there was a memory leak in saving sessions.  This memory leak occured because each time the session was saved, a copy of the session was made and the copy was saved.  Now the copy isn't made.  Instead the session is reverted to its unscaled appearance, saved, and then scaled back to its scale level before it was saved.  This fixes the memory leak and also remedies the situation where the current scale level doesn't have to be saved to the file.
