NoteLab is "free software".  That is, not only can NoteLab be downloaded and used 
at no cost, its source code is also available to be analyzed, modified, and 
contributed to.  For more information on the GNU GPL see the GNU website at 
http://www.gnu.org.

The driving concept behind open-source software is the concept of collaboration.  
That is, with open source software, especially software licensed under the GNU GPL, 
it is not only legal, but encouraged, to encorporate existing open-source software 
projects to new open-source projects to add to the open-source software base.  This 
helps the development of new software, and also helps improve existing software.

With that in mind I, Dominic Kramer, NoteLab's lead software developer, would like 
to thank Silvestre Herrera for his wonderful icon collection Dropline Neu, which, 
prior to NoteLab version 0.2, served as the main icon set for NoteLab.  Most of 
the icons used in NoteLab were created by Silvestre.  However, I did occasionally 
modify some of his icons so that they were customized for NoteLab.  For more 
information about the Dropline Neu, icon set, see Silvestre's website at 
http://www.silvestre.com.ar.   The Dropline Neu icon set used in NoteLab is 
licensed under the GNU GPL.

Also, as of NoteLab version 0.2, the Tango Desktop Project's Tango icon set formed 
the basis for NoteLab's new icon set.  Without the hard work of the developers of 
the Tango icon set, it would have been impossible for me to provide such a nice icons 
for NoteLab.  The Tango Desktop Project's homepage is http://tango.freedesktop.org.

Next I would like to note that although I designed, developed, and wrote the entire 
NoteLab application myself I would like to thank several open-source projects.  That 
is, although I did not use any code from other open-source projects verbatim, I was 
greatly influenced by a few.  Without these projects NoteLab would not be what it 
is.  Thus, I would like to acknowledge them here.

For starters I would like to thank David K. Levine and Gunnar Teege for their note-taking 
application Jarnal.  Many of the concepts seen in NoteLab were inspired by Jarnal.  In 
addition, the initial builds of NoteLab used the icon set used in Jarnal.  Next, in the 
same way Jarnal inspired Notelab, Chris Debenham's Gournal and Denis Auroux's Xournal also 
inspired the development of NoteLab.  

Last I would like to thank the ISAW development team.  I was going to use the ObjectState 
concept from the ISAW project.  However, I found I didn't need to.  Nevertheless, an 
implementation of the ObjectState concept is encorproated into an unused section of the 
NoteLab code.  Furthermore, I would like to thank the ISAW team as it gave me much insight 
into software engineering while I was on the team during my undergraduate career.

For more information about Jarnal, Gournal, Xournal, or ISAW, see their websites at 
http://www.dklevine.com/general/software/tc1000/jarnal.htm, 
http://www.adebenham.com/gournal/, http://math.mit.edu/%7Eauroux/software/xournal/, and 
http://www.pns.anl.gov/computing/isaw/ respectively.

The basic concept of these credits is that the collaborative nature of open-source 
community has allowed myself to develop NoteLab as a very nice application.  As such, I 
strongly encourage everyone to contact me with any questions or comments regarding NoteLab.  
Also you are more than welcome to help develop NoteLab.
