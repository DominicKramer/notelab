\notelab is a software application used for writing handwritten notes.  It is designed to be used with any 
system with either pen or stylus inputs.  \notelab is particularly easy to use on either tablet computers or 
computers with tablets attached.

Tablet computers are very similar to laptops.  With tablet computers, however, you can move a stylus across 
the computers screen to move the computers mouse pointer.  

Similarly, tablets can be attached to non-tablet computers.  These tablets are look similar to mousepads.  However, 
with these you move a stylus across the pad to move the mouse across the computer's screen.

Even if you don't own either of these types of computers, but instead own a traditional computer with a mouse, 
\notelab can still be used.  That is \notelab interprets the movements of the mouse cursor on the computer's screen 
and uses these movements to write handwritten notes.  The mouse cursor can be moved by a mouse or stylus.  \notelab 
works with either.  However, it is usually much easier to use a stylus.
